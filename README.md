# Setup
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/instaf1nder-py.git
$ cd instaf1nder-py
$ sudo ./install
$ instaf1nder
```
here's the one line installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/instaf1nder-py.git && cd instaf1nder-py && sudo ./install && instaf1nder
```

You can add `creds.txt` to the program's folder that contains the username and the password with this format: `{username},{password}` without any space between them and that's pretty much it!

Now your computer should can run the program now by typing `instaf1nder` without any issues :)
